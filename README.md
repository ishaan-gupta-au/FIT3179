# FIT3179_Assignment

Created a webpage containing a series of interactive vega-lite charts. The webpage tells a data story about the impact of cattle on global greenhouse gas emissions and is available for view [here](https://ishaan-gupta-au.github.io/FIT3179_Assignment/).

The data was collated from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production) database and is definitely worth a visit! If you'd like to download the shapefile, feel free to follow the link [here](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/110m_cultural.zip).
